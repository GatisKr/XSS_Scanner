Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites visited by unsuspecting users. It occurs when an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user inputs (like search bars for example), enabling attackers to inject and execute their own scripts in the victimâ€™s browser. XSS attacks can have severe consequences, ranging from theft of sensitive information to unauthorized account access or the spread of malware.
